Follow the directory numbering. Finish `OOP` first, then head on to `SOLID`.

## NOTE

Thoroughout the practices, _DRY_ principal is followed as much as possible. **DRY** stands for **Don't Repeat Yourself** which goes more than just not copy-pasting same code over and over but we won't get into that.
